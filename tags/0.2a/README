Getting started
===============
Extract all files into a directory on a web server running PHP and
optionally MySQL. Open example.php and alter the definitions of DEVELOPER_ID
and DEVELOPER_KEY to match yours. Change the key "example" in the array
definition of $flatLayers to the name your layer has/will have with the
Layar folks. Try accessing the script through a web browser; you should get
a JSON response telling you about missing parameters. If you see this, the
server is running properly.

Create a layer on the Layar development site and have it point at the URL of
your example.php. Open up the Layar developer app, use the fixed location
(52.090473175, 5.11091709137) and you should see the example point of
interest very nearby!

Once this works, you can add your own POIs. If you want to stick to plain
text files, add them to example.tab (or another file in the same format).
Alternatively, create a database in MySQL and use database.sql to create the
POI and Action tables for you. Alter example.php to use the database POI
collector instead of the file POI collector (an example line is near the
bottom of the file, commented out) and you should be good to go.

From there on you're on your own. Build a frontend to manage POIs on the
database or expand PorPOISe to have more features if you need more.
