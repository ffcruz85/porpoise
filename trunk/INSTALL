===PorPOISe installation instructions===

#. Unzip the release into a directory that is not accessible through the web
server. For security reasons, you do not want to expose some files (notable
config.xml) to the web.
#. Make the directory "web/" accessible through the web server. If you have
server administrator rights you should be able to make a new virtual host or
virtual directory for this. If you only have regular user rights and you are on
a UNIX-like system you can make a symbolic link ('ln -s') to the "web/"
directory from a place in your home directory that is accessible through the
web server.
#. Open "http://yourhost/yourdirectory/porpoise.php" and check that you get
JSON output telling you that the parameter "userId" is missing. If you see
this, PorPOISe works.
#. Open "config.xml" in a text editor and fill in your developer ID and
developer key in the appropriate places. If you have worked with PorPOISe
before, you can configure your layers here as well. Otherwise, create layer
data first (see README) and configure it here later.
#. If you plan to use the dashboard, generate a password for user "default" (or
the username of your choice) and store it in "web/dashboard/users.inc.php".
#. If you plan to use the dashboard in conjunction with XML files, you have to
make your XML files writable for the web server. You can make the files
writable by all if you trust all users on your system to behave, othwerwise you
have to come up with a more restrictive setup (such as granting only rights to
the web server user through ACLs or assigning the files to the web server's
group and granting group write permissions).
#. Create and configure your layer on dev.layar.com (if you didn't already),
use the web location of porpoise.php as your POI URL and see what it looks
like!
#. The dashboard is accessible as http://yourhost/yourdirectory/dashboard.
