===PorPOISe upgrading instructions===

= Upgrading from 0.7x to 1.0 =

- backup all your customized files: config.xml, .tab/.xml data files, custom
  POIConnectors, your own XSL files and the users file for the Dashboard.
  Alternatively, just backup your entire PorPOISe directory
- Unpack the 1.0 release
- move your config.xml, layer data files and custom POIConnectors into the new
  "config/" subdirectory
- move your XSL files into the new "config/xsl" subdirectory
- move the Dashboard users file into its old location, "web/dashboard"
- open config.xml and remove the <connector> definitions for the
  FlatPOIConnector, XMLPOIConnector and SQLPOIConnector. These have now been
  built in by default and do not need to be in the configuration file anymore
- open your custom POIConnectors and adjust or remove the references to
  flatpoiconnector.class.php, xmlpoiconnector.class.php and
  sqlpoiconnector.class.php. These files are now included by default and do not
  need explicit inclusion anymore.
- if you need to or want to, follow the instructions in INSTALL to move the
  "config/" directory to a place of your liking. If PorPOISe is in a
  web-accessible directory this enhances security and, in any case, makes for
  easier upgrading

N.B. as of release 1.0 the FlatPOIConnector is deprecated and will no longer be
supported. If you're using the FlatPOIConnector for your layers and need help
converting to XML or database, let us know in the PorPOISe Google Group
