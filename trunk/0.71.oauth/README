===PorPOISe for Layar===
SURFnet's Portable Point-of-Interest Server for Layar

===Introduction===
PorPOISe is a server for Layar clients. It converts your data sets of POIs
(Points of Interest) into responses to the Layar client. Things like JSON
formatting and distance calculation are all done for you. PorPOISe supports
tab-delimited files, XML files and SQL databases as data stores.

===Getting started===
Read INSTALL for installation instructions. Once properly installed, you can
use the dashboard to create your first POIs. The interface is pretty spartan
but this will generate correct output format. Study the format if you intend to
generate your own .tab/.xml files or database.

From here on you're on your own. Build a better interface for the dashboard or
expand PorPOISe to have more features if you need more.

===A note on tab-delimited files===
As Layar gains more features and the data format for responses gets complexer,
the use of a tab-delimited format loses its appeal. Future releases of PorPOISe
may very well drop support for tab-delimited formates. If you're new to
PorPOISe, consider using XML files or a database from the get-go. For those
currently running off of tab-delimited files, the release that drops
tab-delimited support will provide a converter.
